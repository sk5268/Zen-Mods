With the Zen 1.6b update, the ability to disable Workspaces was removed, as it became a core feature of the Zen Browser. However, I believe that users should retain control over their browsing experience.

To address this, I am reintroducing the option to disable Workspaces. Not as a built-in setting, but as a mod for those who prefer this customization.
